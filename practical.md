1.	Directory and File Management:
●	Create a directory structure ./exam/files/test under the current user's home directory.
●	Within the test directory, create a text file named notes.txt and write "JB mid exam notes for Linux" into it using command-line tools.
2.	Using Basic FS Commands:
●	In the test directory, create a backup of notes.txt named backup_notes.txt.
●	List all files in the test directory showing detailed information, including hidden files.
●	Show the disk usage of the test directory in a human-readable format.
3.	Implementing Pipes and Filters:
●	From the test directory, use a pipe to display the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd that contain the letter 'v' and sort them in reverse order.
4.	Set File Permissions:
●	Change the permissions of notes.txt to be readable and writable by the owner, and readable by the group, using numeric syntax.
●	Verify the permissions have been set correctly using commands.
